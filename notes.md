# implementation information
## conventions
### sprite positioning
`thing.spx` is the offset in pixel where to draw the sprite

### hitbox
the hitbox always starts at `thing.x` `thing.y`
the size is specified by `thing.xb` `thing.yb`

# visuals
## font
characters are `3x5` pixels

# ideas
- vertical hud
- animate flame for backward and forward motions (longer and shorter)

## explosions
- varied particles in size colors
- big center explosion ball that pops and shrinks ?
- particles spawning smaller particles ?
- particles type based on their speed ?
- shockwave effect (circle)
### DOJ
- 2 phases
    - big yellow blasts (few)
    - after bigs depop multiple orange to yellow blasts
    - fades to grey

## hit effect
- small oval shape where the bullet hits and disappears
    - this is read as a shielding effect and actually could mean big ennemies in doj shield the smaller side shots which could make sense
- color can be as bold as the shot itself
- ennemies blink in a colored state, quite bold color again(blue in DOJ)
    - big ennemies have fire sprites spawning on them
- x shape ?
- [x] I need to know the impact bullet ennemy position to place properly my hit effect wrt to the bullet

## I just want a big laser shot mannnn
- hit effect for laser shot ==> becomes huge/concentrated(bright, even white) at the impact point


## since the bar is the same color as the ennemy could we design a system where you go and collect sth on them ?

## moonshot (next game/out of scope)
### memorable character integration
- get a cool pilot view on screen that is animated and cool
- characters are grabbing us to games
